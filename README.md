# Nginx module development environment

## Disclaimer 

Module development with Nginx is not a easy task. There are couple of problems contributing to this. In one hand scarcity of updated tutorials is highly being felt and on the other hand, **Nginx** is not welcoming creation of modules instead of delving into configurations and using existing mechanisms to achinve a task. Although the latter is highly valid, there should be some tutorials and references to make the very first steps into module development easier.
